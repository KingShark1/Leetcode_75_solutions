### These are my solutions and approach to Leetcode 75 intermediate problems, solved day-wise.


### TODO: 
1. Decide on the format I'll be uploading my logic in
	- Keeping the code intact from Leetcode, just changing the processing format? 
	- Replicating code everytime i write a problem.
2. Choose the programming language to begin with Python / C++ / Rust (I'd prefer C++)
	- For now I'll be implementing in rust first and port the code to c++ as well.
	- Reason : This would help me learn a new language, while I'd think critically over the data structures part as well. Moreover, my familiarity with C++ isn't as good as it should be, this way, i would also get to know how rust performs better than C++.

3. Start with day 1 ASAP.
